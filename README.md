# Electricy-Price-Relay
A programm for a Wemos D1 mini with a relay hat to minimize electricty costs

As a base it uses the API https://www.hvakosterstrommen.no/strompris-api and parses the electricy prices in Norway in the region you chose. It sorts out the cheapest 18 hours and switches a relay accordingly. 
This helps both to save CO2 and your money on your account so you can work less and spend more time with your beloved ones!
